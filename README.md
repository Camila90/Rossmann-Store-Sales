# ROSSMANN STORE SALES PREDICTION

The work described here is based on my understanding of the lectures from the fast.ai courses (https://www.fast.ai/).

In this project I will be using the dataset from the Kaggle Rossmann Sale Prediction competition. The dataset comprises of about 2.5 years of daily sales data for 1115 different Rossmann stores in Germany.The goal of the competition is to predict the daily sales of each store of Dirk Rossmann GmbH .

I will be using Random Forests and neural networks to try predict the daily sales of Rosmann stores. The project is organized in two parts and each part is presented as seperate notebook in the project folder:
